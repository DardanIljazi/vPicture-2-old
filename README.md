# vPicture-2-old
vPicture 2.0 old source code

This is vPicture 2.0 old source code.
vPicture was a very fast picture uploader.

After long time of non-editing (months now), I decided to put this code online.
This software was going to replace the broken vPicture (www.vpictu.re) software but has never replaced it because of amount of work to manage with others projects I had (Websites + Softwares).
Finally, neither new vPicture website nor new vPicture software have been entirely finished and released.
The project will (certainly) be started again and finished one day.

## What vPicture 2.0 was going to look like (non-exhaustive pictures list)
